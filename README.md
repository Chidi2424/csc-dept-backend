To keep your project clean, you should only have one package.json and package-lock.json in your main backend folder (csc-dept-backend). The ones in the parent BACKEND folder are not needed unless you have a separate project there.

The following files will be deleted:
- c:\Users\CHIDIEBERE\Desktop\CIT_306_PROJECT\BACKEND\package.json
- c:\Users\CHIDIEBERE\Desktop\CIT_306_PROJECT\BACKEND\package-lock.json
